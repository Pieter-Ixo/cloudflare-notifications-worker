The provided code defines a server application using the Hono framework on Cloudflare Workers, integrated with the Expo SDK for handling push notifications.

## Application Setup

- Dependencies: The code uses `hono` for the server framework and `expo-server-sdk` for handling Expo push notifications.
- Middleware: Three middlewares are used:
  - `poweredBy`: Removes or customizes the `X-Powered-By` header.
  - `cors`: Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
  - Custom Authorization Middleware: Checks the `Authorization` header against an environment variable `AUTHORIZATION`. If it doesn't match, it returns a `401 Unauthorized` response.

## Routes

- **GET /** Returns a simple greeting message, "Hello IXO!", to test server running.
- **GET /test/:token** A route handled by Notifications.sendTestNotification. It sends a test push notification to an Expo push token.
- **GET /receipt/:ticket** Handled by Notifications.fetchTicketReceipt. It retrieves the receipt for a previously sent push notification based on its ticket.

## Develop

- Ensure you have Cloudflare Workers account and CLI configured.
- Copy `example wrangler.toml` as `wrangler.toml`
- Set the `AUTHORIZATION` variable in the new `wrangler.toml` file with your secret key.
